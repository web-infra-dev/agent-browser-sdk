# Browser Agent Infra

Browser Agent Infra is dedicated to building a comprehensive browser infrastructure toolkit designed for AI agents and browser automation.

This monorepo provides a complete set of packages for browser detection, control and UI interaction —— everything you need to build intelligent browser automation systems.

Currently, the business users of this Infra include [UI-TARS-desktop](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop/#ui-tars-desktop) and [Agent TARS](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop/#agent-tars), with more agents or apps to be integrated in the future.

<br />

## What is this for?

This toolkit is specifically designed for:

- **AI Agents** that need to interact with web browsers
- **Browser Automation** tools and testing frameworks
- **Remote Browser Control** applications
- **Web Scraping** and data extraction systems
- **Cross-platform Browser** detection and management
